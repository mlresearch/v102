title: Learning from sparsely annotated data for semantic segmentation in histopathology
  images
abstract: We investigate the problem of building convolutional networks for semantic
  segmentation in histopathology images when weak supervision in the form of sparse
  manual annotations is provided in the training set. We propose to address this problem
  by modifying the loss function in order to balance the contribution of each pixel
  of the input data. We introduce and compare two approaches of loss balancing when
  sparse annotations are provided, namely (1) instance based balancing and (2) mini-batch
  based balancing. We also consider a scenario of full supervision in the form of
  dense annotations, and compare the performance of using either sparse or dense annotations
  with the proposed balancing schemes. Finally, we show that using a bulk of sparse
  annotations and a small fraction of dense annotations allows to achieve performance
  comparable to full supervision.
