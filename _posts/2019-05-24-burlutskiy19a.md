title: Segmenting Potentially Cancerous Areas in Prostate Biopsies using Semi-Automatically
  Annotated Data
abstract: Gleason grading specified in ISUP 2014 is the clinical standard in staging
  prostate cancer and the most important part of the treatment decision. However,
  the grading is subjective and suffers from high intra and inter-user variability.
  To improve the consistency and objectivity in the grading, we introduced glandular
  tissue WithOut Basal cells (WOB) as the ground truth. The presence of basal cells
  is the most accepted biomarker for benign glandular tissue and the absence of basal
  cells is a strong indicator of acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma, the most common
  form of prostate cancer. Glandular tissue can objectively be assessed as WOB or
  not WOB by using specific immunostaining for glandular tissue (Cytokeratin 8/18)
  and for basal cells (Cytokeratin 5/6 + p63). Even more, WOB allowed us to develop
  a semi-automated data generation pipeline to speed up the tremendously time consuming
  and expensive process of annotating whole slide images by pathologists. We generated
  295 prostatectomy images exhaustively annotated with WOB. Then we used our Deep
  Learning Framework, which achieved the $2^{nd}$ best reported score in Camelyon17
  Challenge, to train networks for segmenting WOB in needle biopsies. Evaluation of
  the model on 63 needle biopsies showed promising results which were improved further
  by finetuning the model on 118 biopsies annotated with WOB, achieving F1-score of
  0.80 and Precision-Recall AUC of 0.89 at the pixel-level. Then we compared the performance
  of the model against 17 biopsies annotated independently by 3 pathologists using
  only H&E staining. The comparison demonstrated that the model performed on a par
  with the pathologists. Finally, the model detected and accurately outlined existing
  WOB areas in two biopsies incorrectly annotated as totally WOB-free biopsies by
  three pathologists and in one biopsy by two pathologists.
