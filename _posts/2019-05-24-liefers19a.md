title: 'Dense Segmentation in Selected Dimensions: Application to Retinal Optical
  Coherence Tomography'
abstract: 'We present a novel convolutional neural network architecture designed for
  dense segmentation in a subset of the dimensions of the input data.  The architecture
  takes an N-dimensional image as input, and produces a label for every pixel in M
  output dimensions, where 0 < M < N. Large context is incorporated by an encoder-decoder
  structure, while funneling shortcut subnetworks provide precise localization. We
  demonstrate applicability of the architecture on two problems in retinal optical
  coherence tomography: segmentation of geographic atrophy and segmentation of retinal
  layers. Performance is compared against two baseline methods, that leave out either
  the encoder-decoder structure or the shortcut subnetworks. For segmentation of geographic
  atrophy, an average Dice score of 0.49 ± 0.21 was obtained, compared to 0.46 ± 0.22
  and 0.28 ± 0.19 for the baseline methods, respectively. For the layer-segmentation
  task, the proposed architecture achieved a mean absolute error of 1.305 ± 0.547
  pixels compared to 1.967 ± 0.841 and 2.166 ± 0.886± for the baseline methods.'
