title: Learning beamforming in ultrasound imaging
abstract: Medical ultrasound (US) is a widespread imaging modality owing its popularity
  to cost efficiency, portability, speed, and lack of harmful ionizing radiation.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that replacing the traditional ultrasound processing
  pipeline with a data-driven, learnable counterpart leads to significant improvement
  in image quality. Moreover, we demonstrate that greater improvement can be achieved
  through a learning-based design of the transmitted beam patterns simultaneously
  with learning an image reconstruction pipeline. We evaluate our method on an in-vivo
  first-harmonic cardiac ultrasound dataset acquired from volunteers and demonstrate
  the significance of the learned pipeline and transmit beam patterns on the image
  quality when compared to standard transmit and receive beamformers used in high
  frame-rate US imaging. We believe that the presented methodology provides a fundamentally
  different perspective on the classical problem of ultrasound beam pattern design.
